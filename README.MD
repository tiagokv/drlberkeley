# Overview

These exercises were done based on the [CS 294: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Fall 2017](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) course.

- hw1: Is an imitation learning with/without Dagger
- hw2: Deep Policy Gradients
- hw3: Deep Q-Learning with Atari games
- hw4: Model-based with Deep Learning and MPC

PS.: The Spring 2017 exercises were not done, hence left empty.

PS2.: Some of the exercises had to be change to for recent MuJoCo and Tensorflow versions (I tried to use the most recent ones).

Feel free to point out if something is wrong or if you have any other tip.
